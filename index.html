		<h1>Description:</h1>
		<p>I have made a Calculator, This program can Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.</p>
		<p>At first I tried to make a calculator with canopy, making and realsitic looking calculator. But, later I found out I wasn't advanced enough to attack that process.</p>
		<p>I figured this after two days into the project, Which hindered me from inputting more code into the project.</p>
		<p>Even though I had two days to finish all my coding for my new project, I never thought of failing I dove strait in and started inputing code that would Add, Subtract, Multiply, and divide.</p>
		<p>The project cosist of buttons that are coded to Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide. When I insert two numbers into drawpad, I have the option to Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.</p>
		
		<p>If I had more time to wrok on this project I would have made it so that the caculator could use all it's attributes and use numbers like 600 and 500 instead of just single or two diget numbers.</p>
